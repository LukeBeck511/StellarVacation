    What do I need to bring on my trip?
</p>
<p>
    Bring yourself and any normal things you would bring to a hotel on Earth. Stellar Hotels have all of the normal amenities that most hotels have plus more! Just make sure you have the time, and that you mentally prepare yourself for the journey to stay in the Stellar Hotel! Make sure you know when you're going and which one of our packages you're using!

<p class="question-color">
    Do I need to do anything to prepare for my trip?
</p>
<p>
    Yes, be mentally prepared to be in space for how ever long your package is. Exercise beforehand is not required but it can help with adapting to space, and our fabulous hotel.
