    About Our Docking System:
</p>
<p>
    The rocket will dock with the hotel using the same system as the ISS does when transporting people from their station to Earth. It uses the orbital docking system,(ODS). When the rocket accelerates up to Stellar Hotel, The docking ring will first attach the ship to the Hotel and not attach rigidly. Then it will pull it into the base ring which will rigidly lock the two vehicles to each other and create an air lock, which allows the pilot and people inside the Hotel to start the unloading process. When undocking, the undocking springs will decompress and allow the ship to leave and head back to earth.

    About Our Rocket:
</p>
<p>
    We use serial multistage liquid rockets to get you to the hotel. During the flight, the propulsion unit (the bottom half of the rocket) will detach from the main rocket; as it just helped the main part get past the atmosphere. As the bottom half starts to fall back to Earth, it will release its wings on each side that will extend to allow the rocket to glide back down into its set landing point, with no damage to the ship.
