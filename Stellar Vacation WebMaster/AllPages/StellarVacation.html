    Stellar Vacation is the company to choose for space travel and tourism.
</p>
<p>
    Our company, Stellar Vacation, is revolutionizing space tourism. We bring people up to space to stay in our luxurious space hotel. We provide personal trainers for all of our visitors to stay fit and adapt to space. Our hotel has the latest technology and amenities, including a space centrifuge which provides artificial gravity within our Hotel! Staying in our hotel lets you be able to experience everything an astronaut does, with less health risks. You are still able to relax and experience the wonders of being off of our planet without worry. All of our rooms are equipped with our own A.I, “David”. David can help with any questions or needs you may have while you stay here. In your room, you have wall to wall TV screens that can actively broadcast the sights outside of the hotel, so you will always get the immersion of having windows and being about to see all of the views.
